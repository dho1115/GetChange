January 27th:
This is an app that will "change up" and give you "change" in a higher denomination. Think of it as one of those machines that changes your pennies to a HIGHER currency (e.g.: dollar bills, quarters, nickels, etc...).
So, if I have 4 quarters, it will show that is equivalent to 1 dollar. It will not show, say, 10 dimes b/c a dime is lesser value than the quarter I provided, hence, "change up".

I do intend to make changes in the code and app, modify and refactor this since this was (kind of) hastily built.
